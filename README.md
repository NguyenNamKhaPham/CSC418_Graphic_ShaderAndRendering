The project is to implement ray-tracers and render scenes using ray casting and local (direct) illumination. It includes:
- Casting rays from the camera towards each pixel of the image plane
- Ray-sphere intersection, ray-square intersection, ray-cylinder intersection
- Phong illumination for a point light source
- Anti-aliasing
- Depth of field
- Softshadow
- Refraction 
- Reflection
